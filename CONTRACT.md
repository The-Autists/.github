# This Document is a work in progress and we are updating it live here as we feel it goes with the open nature of what we are doing here with the open source software that we are producing

## This will outline the default contract between us (collectively 'us, we, our' as "The Autists") and anyone who chooses to contribute to, and or use our software and services.

### Section 1 - Security

being an open source project, we are by nature a more secure project, and this in turn applies to the majority of the projects owned, operated, maintained, and or distributed by us and our contributers. This does not mean that there are no ways that security vulnurabilities can make it into our code, and we will do our best to find and negate them ourselves, though we are also looking to the wider community to help us manage the security vulnerabilites that may or may not exist in our code.

  - 1.0.1 - Disclosure
    - Due to the distributed nature of the locations that our code is displayed, contributed too, and used in, we have to account for the disclosure laws of a large number of judistrictions when it comes to informing people of any vulurabilities in our code. We will make regular announcements reguarding known exploits, end of life of software, and open availibility of our software under our [secondary granted licence](https://github.com/The-Autists/.github/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and anything else that is brought to our attention in our [Discord Server](https://github.com/awfixer) as well as on any mailing lists and RSS feeds that we may develope or have part in, in the future.
      
    - We also maintain several blogs, and we will be sure to disclose any known breaches of user data in those blogs using the respective blogs mailing lists and news letters
  - 1.0.2 - Mitigation
    - WIP
